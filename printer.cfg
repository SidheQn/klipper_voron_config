#   Most moves will accelerate to a cruising speed, travel at that
#   cruising speed, and then decelerate. However, some moves that
#   travel a short distance could nominally accelerate and then
#   immediately decelerate. This option reduces the top speed of these
#   moves to ensure there is always a minimum distance traveled at a
#   cruising speed. That is, it enforces a minimum distance traveled
#   at cruising speed relative to the total distance traveled. It is
#   intended to reduce the top speed of short zigzag moves (and thus
#   reduce printer vibration from these moves). For example, a
#   minimum_cruise_ratio of 0.5 would ensure that a standalone 1.5mm
#   move would have a minimum cruising distance of 0.75mm. Specify a
#   ratio of 0.0 to disable this feature (there would be no minimum
#   cruising distance enforced between acceleration and deceleration).
#   The value specified here may be changed at runtime using the
#   SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT command. The default is 0.5.

##### The Sensorless homing calibration process is: #####

# For TMC2209, start with SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGTHRS STEPPER=stepper_x VALUE=255 in the console. For TMC2130/TMC2660/TMC5160, use SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGT STEPPER=stepper_x VALUE=-64 instead.

# Start with the most sensitive value for the StallGuard threshold based on which kind of TMC driver you’re using (255 for TMC2209, or -64 for TMC2130/TMC2660/TMC5160).
# Try running G28 X0 to see if the toolhead moves along the X axis.
# If your toolhead moves all the way to the end of the rail, IMMEDIATELY HIT THE EMERGENCY STOP BUTTON.
# Go back and double-check that you have configured your hardware and the Klipper sections above correctly. Ask on Discord if you need help.

# When running the G28 X0 or G28 Y0 command, the toolhead WILL move ever so slightly before it triggers the virtual endstop. This is normal.
# After triggering the toolhead will also move 10mm beck in the opposite direction. for example: if you stallguard value is too high you may observe the toolhead only moving 10mm to the left.
# This is expected and simply means your stallguard value is still too sensative for the toolhead to overcome the resistance in the beltpath.
# As described above when you first start trying to find your value, it will look like the toolhead is moving away from the right rail, then stopping.
# This is normal and just means the value is still too sensitive to home properly. Early on, you can jump down in jumps of 50.
# To change the stallguard value quickly simply enter SET_TMC_FIELD FIELD=SGTHRS STEPPER=stepper_x VALUE=XXX into the console, replacing the XXX with your desired stallgurad value to test.
# This command only overwrites the value temporarily so when you are finished it will have to be updated in your actual printer.cfg file.

# At some point you will get X to home all the way to the rail. However, if you went TOO low, it might bump harder into the rail than it should. In this case, split the difference and try homing the axis again.

# Eventually you will find the BIGGEST number that homes X successfully. Nice! With the maximum found, continue to DECREASE the value by 5 or so until X homes,
# but bumps too hard into the rail. You may need to walk this in by changing the value by 1 when getting close. This is your MINIUMUM value.
# Ideally we want to hard code a final value between the minimum and maximum that will always work, it is best to shoot for something slightly LESS than halfway between minimum and maximum.

# Example: If maximum is 113 and minimum is 99, the difference is 14. Half of 14 is 7, so use a value of 99+6, or 105.
# If that looks and feels good, you now have the driver value that you need in order to update your printer.cfg file’s [tmc2209 stepper_x] section.
